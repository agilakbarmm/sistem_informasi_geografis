Sistem Informasi Geografis (SIG) Project Repository
This repository contains the source code, data, and documentation for a Geographic Information System (GIS) project. The project aims to explore the use of GIS layers to visualize, analyze, and interpret spatial data. It includes:

Data Processing: Import and processing of geographic vector (point, line, polygon) and raster data (satellite images, DEM).

Spatial Analysis: Applying spatial queries and analysis techniques like buffering, overlay, and network analysis.

Visualization: Layer-based visualization of maps with various thematic data.
Tools and Libraries: Implementation using GIS software and libraries such as QGIS, GDAL, and others.

This project was completed as part of the GIS coursework.
